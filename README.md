# Simple-C-Shell

A shell in C that mimics some of the most popular commands used in Bash but for Windows

The aliases implemented are intended to be paths, so entering `add_alias my_program C:\Users\Username\Downloads\my_program.exe`, 
then entering `launch my_program` will launch the program

This also works with PDFs / word docs (`open`) and folders (`explore`)

Check `help` to see the commands that I implemented
